# Connect4I
An implemenation of the minimax algorithm, neural networks, and genetic algorithms to create a skilled Connect4 and TicTacToe players. This project was created during the course of Hack RPI and is being improved upon incrementally. Currently, I am trying to apply the minimax algorithm to map the gamespace of the games and evaluating the best move at each legal board configuration. Then, I hope to use supervised learning to train a model to recognize the best move to provide reasonably skilled players. A genetic algorithm will then be used to evolve the players.
