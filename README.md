# Connect4I
An implemenation of the minimax algorithm, neural networks, and genetic algorithms to create skilled Connect4 and TicTacToe players (since they both rely on similar x-in-a-row goals and adversarial but the latter has a smaller game board). This project was started during the HackRPI Fall 2016 Student Hackathon and is being improved upon incrementally. Currently, I am trying to apply the minimax algorithm to map all possible board states of the games and evaluating the best move at each legal board configuration. Then, I hope to use supervised learning to train a model to recognize the best move to provide reasonably skilled players. A genetic algorithm will then be used to evolve the players.

## Detail on progress is in the README in the TicTacToe folder...
